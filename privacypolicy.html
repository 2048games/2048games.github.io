<h3><b style="color:#CC0000">Privacy Policy of Super 2048 Free</b></h3>
<p><b style="color:#CC9900">Privacy Policy:</b><p>
<p>This Privacy Policy defines how we read and write user's external storage in our mobile application.</p>
<br>
<p><b style="color:#CC9900">Personal Data:</b></p>
<p>Super 2048 Free respects your privacy rights.</p>
<br>
<p><b style="color:#CC9900">Children / Children's Online Privacy Protection Act:</b></p>
<p>Our App comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We don't collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To the extent we feel that our App is directed to children under the age of 13, we will not collect Personal Information from users of this App. </p>
<br>
<p>We may collect Non-personal Information, such as a device ID or other persistent identifier linked to the device or computer, which may be used by a child to play our App. The data collected will be anonymous and not tied to any Personal Information. In addition, this data will be used solely for internal purposes such as personalization of content, security, and contextual (not behavioral) advertising.</p>
<br>
<p>Certain of our App may permit in-game purchases, even if the applicable game was free to download. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account. If you are a parent who is concerned about this feature, you may disable the ability to make in-game purchases.</p>
<br>
<p><b style="color:#CC9900">Policy Updates:</b></p>
<p>This Policy may change from time to time. We will always keep this up to date so that you know what information we will collect from you, how we may use it, and when we may disclose it.</p>
